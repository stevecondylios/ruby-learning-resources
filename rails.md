This may become its own repo. For now including in ruby-learning-resources


The purpose is to collect rails tid-bits that will serve as a useful reminder for anyone forgetful.


# TODO

- Learn about and add notes on ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do ... and ActiveRecord::Rollback
  - Useful Q&A [here](https://chatgpt.com/c/67495ad2-51ac-8008-b323-6e97120fe749)
  - Related: get thorough about error and exception handling.


# Random notes

- The average rails app has 1.03 lines of test code for every line of code in the app! [Source](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/2018/04/11/state-of-testing-in-rails.html)
- Brilliant explanation of why modern rails apps are started with `bin/dev` instead of `rails server` [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGpt2TEkDqo&t=78s) (spoiler: css updates run through a separate process, so the bin/dev script installs foreman if it's not installed and then starts the Procfile (.dev version) which starts the various processes).


# Important resources

- How to look up rails documentation: [api.rubyonrails.org](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/Table.html#method-i-timestamps) - **use the search bar on top left**
  - And how to find out which module/class a method comes from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76500645/5783745).
    - Basically: `method(:render).source_location` where 'render' is the method you want to look up (and remember to do it in the same scope as you're using it in the app - e.g. the view, but could be anywhere else - use `binding.pry` if necessary)
- [Rails guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) (these aren't 'read once and forget' - experienced devs use them daily)
- To get source code of any ruby/rails method from the rails console [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70819821/5783745)
- Awesome list of ruby gems by category [here](https://opensource-heroes.com/awesome/ruby)
- Nice list of ruby gems used in a typical application [here](https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/1669794416343523355?s=20)

# How to setup your working environment (IDE, terminal etc)

- Great video on vscode extensions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXTmd-4jx8g)



# Notes from [Rails 7 demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpWFrUwAN88)

- `.deliver_later` knows to run inline in development, and for it to work properly (i.e. asynchonously) in production, it requires some setup of (??)
- Rich text fields
-





# Rails environments: test / dev / prod

- `rails console` will get you the rails console. `RAILS_ENV=test rails c` will open the rails console in test mode!
  - Similarly, to reset the test database: `RAILS_ENV=test rails db:reset`




### Debugging

Typically, best to use `binding.pry`.

Then (from ChatGPT):

- `next`: Steps over the method call (like skipping over the method body).

- `step`: Steps into the method call (like a deep dive).

- `continue` or `c`: Resumes normal program execution until the next breakpoint or end.


- ctrl + d to end pry session

- Note: it would be great to have keybindings for next and step, although I don't think they exist.




### Credentials


Open credentials with

```
EDITOR="vim" bin/rails credentials:edit
```

Example credentials.yml

```
aws:
  access_key_id: 123
  secret_access_key: 345
```

And access the variables like so

```
# Print credentials
Rails.application.credentials
```


### Note: a nice idea is to scope credentials to production, development and test environments

```
production:
  myvar:
    first_thing: abcd
    second_thing: defg

development:
  myvar:
    first_thing: abcd
    second_thing: defg

test:
  myvar:
    first_thing: abcd
    second_thing: defg
```

And then use this to access them in the various environments:

```
Rails.application.credentials[Rails.env.to_sym]
```




### How to display errors in the view (e.g. after a form validation error)

- Controller re-renders new View when model fails to save

e.g.

```rb
  if @simulation.save
    redirect_to action: 'index'
  else
    render 'new'
  end
```

Since it's using render, that will send the same model instance back to the view, and it will at that stage have errors, hence the code at the top of the scaffold will run. E.g. something like this:


```erb
<%= form_with(model: report) do |form| %>
  <% if report.errors.any? %>
    <div style="color: red">
      <h2><%= pluralize(report.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this report from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
        <% report.errors.each do |error| %>
          <li><%= error.full_message %></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>
```

Note, I'm pretty sure you can roll your own mechanism, just create something like `@errors` in the controller, and some logic to display it in the view.


### How to make flash messages in the view

Reading:

- [SO: How to show error message on rails views?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31092957/5783745)
- [Flash Messages](https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/11/rails-flash-messages/)
  - The flash object has methods like `keys`, `any?` or `each` & you can access a particular message with `[]`.

By default you have `notice` and `alart`, e.g.:

```rb
flash.alert = "User not found."
```

or like this

```rb
redirect_to :books_path, notice: "Book not found"
```

And to render the flash messages:

```
<% flash.each do |type, msg| %>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <%= msg %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Keep in mind:

- If you redirect_to, then render a flash message, that’s good
- If you redirect_to & DON’T render the message, the message will stick around, in the flash hash
- If you render on the same action that you’re setting the flash message, that flash message will be available, but NOT removed so it will stay around & potentially be shown twice



When using render, you may wish to use `flash.now` to render on the *current* action:

```rb
# In controller
flash.now[:notice] = "We have exactly #{@books.size} books available."
```


### How to tell where the user navigated from

Use [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18151260/5783745):

```rb
URI(request.referrer).path
# "/products/14"
```

Could be used to conditionally display a button or text conditionally when the user navigated from some location.












# Controllers

This will let the url respond to `.html` (or no extension), vs `.json` (or other extensions in the url):

```rb

respond_to do |format|
  format.html {} # Note that if it's empty that will give the default response (e.g. for the show action, it would render show.html.erb)
  format.json
end
```

Also note that if there's no `respond_to` block in the controller action, and a `.json` url is accessed, it will look for a jbuilder file, which is a ruby DSL to generate json. Note that it's not necessary to use jbuilder, you can always fall back on plain old ruby and `.to_json` or `.as_json` instead.




### Concerns

Problem: say you have a method in a controller (say 'bookings_controller.rb'), and everything's great, then you realise you need to use that method in another controller (say, 'events_controller.rb'), then what? You could duplciate the code. But best practice is to create a concern for shared code between the 2 or more controllers.
  - A concern looks like this:


```ruby

# app/controllers/concerns/booking_event_helpers.rb
module BookingEventHelpers
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  def some_method_to_be_used_in_both_controllers
    #
  end
end


```


And to use the `some_method_to_be_used_in_both_controllers` method in either events or bookings controller, just add this to the controller:


```ruby

include BookingEventHelpers


```


# Model associations

Know the [3 big ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZNfSQKC-Yk&t=880s) well:

- has_many
- belongs_to
- has_many :through



### has_and_belongs_to_many

Sc note: after a fair bit of reading, **there's virtually no reason not to use has_many :through (instead of HABTM)** basically all the time. Rationale: the cost is you have to name a join model (as opposed to simply have a table with ids of both the tables it joins), so now you have to think of a name for that join table, but the benefits you get are: 1. You can now have attributes on that model (now or in the future), 2. You can have validations on that model (E.g. airbnb host can only be a host on the same property once - wouldn't make sense to simultaneously be the host of the same property twice as the same time, based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24559591/5783745) you wouldn't be able to validate it if it was just a model-less table as with HABTM).

Also [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2780798/has-and-belongs-to-many-vs-has-many-through#comment101519442_2781049) says:

> The punch line here is that you will always end up needing to add attributes to your join table, sooner or later. Go ahead and use has_many through: from the beginning and save pain later.

sc: the only thing I'd add to this is if you want the flexibility to move away from has_many :through to HABTM (pretty unlikely tbh) then you should name your join table according to HABTM conventions, which is in alphabetical order. What would motivate a change from HMT to HABTM? The only thing I can think of is if you don't like the join model's name (it causes confusion in development or something like that), and so you prefer there be no join model and just a table instead. Seems like a *very* weak motivator though.

TL;DR always go with has_many through unless you really hate having to put a name on the join model or you're extremely certain you won't need attributes nor validations on the join model.

Reminder: has_many through requires more than the one line in the model to define, namely, it needs two lines per model, [like so](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-many-through-association) (could be easy to overlook that since it's the only model association requiring >1 line to delcare):


```
class Physician < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :patients, through: :appointments
end

class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :physician
  belongs_to :patient
end

class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :physicians, through: :appointments
end
```




[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbpye74Wt2o) video says:

> Don't use (has_and_belongs_to_many) when you need validations, callbacks, or extra attributes on the join model

(but I suspect by 'join model' it means the little model rails sets up *inbetween* the two models connected by has_and_belongs_to_many, so I think has_and_belongs_to_many should still be fine for my purposes)


- A 'Join Table' is just a table that has two columns, model1_id, and model2_id, that way for a given model1_id you can see all the model2_ids, and vice-verse. I.e. allowing a many to many relationship.

Resources on HABTM:
- Great diagram [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34565148/what-is-the-use-of-join-table-in-rails#comment127295361_34565307) (3rd/last diagram)
- How to create a HABTM migration [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5917599/5783745)
- Note that the join table should be defined ***alphabetically*** (see [here](https://apidock.com/rails/v6.1.3.1/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods/has_and_belongs_to_many)):

> Developer and Project will give the default join table name of “developers_projects” because “D” precedes “P” alphabetically

- Rails Guide on [HABTM](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-and-belongs-to-many-association) is really good.

- How to create a join table, see [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#creating-a-join-table)


Note that for uuid in the join table, need the extra parameter in the migration:

```rb
    create_join_table :landlords, :properties, column_options: {type: :uuid} do |t|
      t.index [:landlord_id, :property_id]
      t.index [:property_id, :landlord_id]
    end
```

How to create records in the join table

```rb

Landlord.first.properties << Property.first
Landlord.first.properties

# Note that nothing stops duplicates.

```

Note that `Landlord.first.properties.first.destory` would delete **the actual property** record. To remove just the *association* (not the object), use [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21279265/5783745) method (untested by me).


### Database and migrations

Notes:

- The [strong migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations#changing-the-type-of-a-column) gem lets you try to do a migration but it will stop you if you're going to do it in a way that would be unsafe. Probably a great idea to use this gem as soon as an app has consistent usage.



# Enums

See

- [Rails guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#enums) enums section
- [This video](://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiceC-m2UmI&t=575s)
- [rails 7 enum syntax](https://blog.saeloun.com/2021/02/26/rails-introduces-new-syntax-for-enum/)

But basically all you need to do is

- Have a column that's an integer
- Add something like this to the model file


```
enum :status, { published: 0, draft: 1, archieved: 2 }
```

and the form field should look like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49851936/5783745):

```
<%= form.select :incomeType, options_for_select([['Income', 'income'], ['Allowance', 'allowance']]), id: :incomeType %>
```

Note the array of arrays, where subarrays are length 2. The subarray contains what you want the user to see followed by what you want to pass to the database, in that order. I haven't looked particularly hard, but I suprisingly didn't find much documentation on how enums should be dealt with in the view, so I'm going by the stack overflow answer unless I find something better.


Some other (awesome) ways to populate the enum values in the form [here](https://spaquet.medium.com/activerecord-enum-and-activeview-form-f09dca0ea4b0):

```
<div>
  <%= form.label :status %>
  <%= form.select :status, Post.statuses.keys %>
</div>
```


```
<div>
  <%= form.label :status %>
  <%= form.select :status, Post.statuses.keys.map{ |key| [key.humanize, key] }, selected: @post.status || :draft %>
</div>
```






# Scopes


> Scopes are custom queries that you define inside your Rails models with the scope method. From [here](https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/10/scopes-in-ruby-on-rails/)


In your controller you might want to only show published posts:

```ruby

def index

  @posts = Post.all.where(status: "Published")

end
```

Another (more elegant) way to do this is jumping into your Post model and creating a scope (the `scope` method appears to accept 2 arguments, a name for the scope, and a lambda that contains the code for the scope), such that:


```ruby

scope :published, -> { where(status: "Published") }

```

Then in your controller you can have this:


```ruby

@posts = Post.published

```

And it will do the exact same thing.

So TL;DR scopes are a great way to keep controller code DRY, and move some controller code into the model.


**A note on default scopes** - [Don't use default scopes!](https://piechowski.io/post/why-is-default-scope-bad-rails/) - The case for not using default scopes is strong: they look convenient, but really just mess with your queries - steer well clear. `default_scope`s  tend to [make a massive mess](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25087336/why-is-using-the-rails-default-scope-often-recommend-against)!.















# Testing

- Awesome [rails guide on testing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html)
  - It covers **unit**, **functional**, **integration**, and **system** tests
- Nice reinteractive [article](https://reinteractive.com/posts/342-what-constitutes-good-testing-in-rails) on what constitutes good testing
- JS article on the specific kinds of tests he uses in a rails app ([here](https://www.codewithjason.com/set-rails-application-testing/))


The purpose of testing is to:

> ensure your code adheres to the desired functionality even after some major code refactoring.

> Rails tests can also simulate browser requests and thus you can test your application's response without having to test it through your browser.


### Types of tests



A quick note on how DHH tests (from his podcast appearance on *corecursive* podcast [here](https://corecursive.com/045-david-heinemeier-hansson-software-contrarian/#)):

- DHH writes:
  - **model tests** (which incorporate everything unit tests do, but may also talk to the database),
  - **controller tests** (which, like model tests, talk to the db)
  - **system tests** which "flex the system"

- When talking to the db, he uses real models, not mocks or stubs
- He usually has about half the amount of test code as app code (typically no need for super fine grained unit tests)

<hr>

The rails guide [introduces 4 types of tests](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html):

> How to write unit, functional, integration, and system tests for your application.

1. Unit tests
  - e.g. testing minute details in a methods inputs/outputs
  - A unit test is about testing a single function/method in isolation with all of its possible outputs. ([source](https://developers.forem.com/tests/unit-functional-tests))
2. [Functional tests](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#functional-tests-for-your-controllers) (AKA Controller Tests)
  - 'testing that controllers and models are using the mailer in the right way'
  - A functional test is about testing a single functionality, which can span multiple methods and a controller. Other common terms in Rails are "model tests," "controller tests," and others. ([source](https://developers.forem.com/tests/unit-functional-tests))
  - SC thinking: Based on the examples I see in a MRE test rails app, I *think* controller tests test things like whether a GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE to a certain url works, whether a new record is created/deleted in the right table, and whether any redirect occurs as expected.
    - But note (from [rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#available-request-types-for-functional-tests)):
    > Functional tests do not verify whether the specified request type is accepted by the action, we're more concerned with the result. Request tests exist for this use case to make your tests more purposeful.
    - Also note under 'functional tests' (aka controller tests) the [rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#putting-it-together) gives an example of a test that reloads the fixure after a PATCH, and checks that the new attribute was indeed updated as expected.
    - Note that Rspec recommends not doing controller tests (since around 2018), and now recommends [request tests](https://medium.com/just-tech/rspec-controller-or-request-specs-d93ef563ef11) which are like integration tests and route tests conbined.
3. Integration tests
  - Integration tests are used to test how various parts of our application interact. They are generally used to test important workflows within our application. ([source](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#integration-testing))
  - An integration test is a test that measures the interaction of multiple systems or parts of your application. ([source](https://developers.forem.com/tests/integration-tests))
4. System tests ([AKA **acceptance tests**, **feature tests**](https://developers.forem.com/tests/acceptance-tests#:~:text=Acceptance%20tests%20are%20tests%20from,actions%20inside%20of%20our%20tests.&text=Acceptance%20tests%20can%20be%20found%20in%20the%20directory%20spec%2Fsystem%20.))
  - Great practical [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNZt7FCVYro) to get started quickly.
  - Might use capibara (a ruby tool for managing selenium) to visit a certain route, and see if it can see what it expects on the page (see great example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPcRiPrpQTc))
  - System tests allow you to test user interactions with your application, running tests in either a real or a headless browser. System tests use Capybara under the hood. ([source](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#system-testing))
  - Good thoughtbot cheatsheet on accepting testing in Rspec [here](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/test-driven-rails-resources/rspec_acceptance.pdf) which uses `feature` and `scenario` e.g. (feature 'Signing in' do
  scenario 'signs the user in successfully with a valid email and password')
  - SC thinking: I *think* system tests use a browser and simulate mouse clicks, then check if the next page has what we expect on it. I think the distinguishing characteristic of system tests is that system tests are confirming what's going on *from the user's perspective*, that is, based on things a user would do, and based on what a user would see.

Other notes:

- Acceptance tests are also known as Feature tests or System tests. ([source](https://developers.forem.com/tests/acceptance-tests#:~:text=Acceptance%20tests%20are%20tests%20from,actions%20inside%20of%20our%20tests.&text=Acceptance%20tests%20can%20be%20found%20in%20the%20directory%20spec%2Fsystem%20.))

On mailer tests:

> There are two aspects of testing your mailer, the **unit tests** and the **functional tests**. In the unit tests, you run the mailer in isolation with tightly controlled inputs and compare the output to a known value (a fixture). In the functional tests you don't so much test the minute details produced by the mailer; instead, we test that our controllers and models are using the mailer in the right way. You test to prove that the right email was sent at the right time.

> Functional tests do not verify whether the specified request type is accepted by the action, we're more concerned with the result. Request tests exist for this use case to make your tests more purposeful. ([source](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#available-request-types-for-functional-tests))


### What is acceptance testing?

From top of google [results](https://developers.forem.com/tests/acceptance-tests#:~:text=Acceptance%20tests%20are%20tests%20from,actions%20inside%20of%20our%20tests.&text=Acceptance%20tests%20can%20be%20found%20in%20the%20directory%20spec%2Fsystem%20.):

> **Acceptance tests are tests from the perspective of the end-user**. In the Rails world, we sometimes refer to these as **Feature tests** or **System tests**. A tool called Capybara is included to help us simulate a human's actions inside of our tests.

From the [RSpec cheat sheet on acceptance tests](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/test-driven-rails-resources/rspec_acceptance.pdf). Very elucidating example [here](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/test-driven-rails-resources/rspec_acceptance.pdf).


From Jason K:

> You might have an acceptance test to make sure that when that route is visited, the db is 'fixtured up' and something displayed in the view

From Jason S ([here](https://www.codewithjason.com/set-rails-application-testing/)):

> Capybara is a tool for writing acceptance tests, i.e. tests that interact with the browser and simulate clicks and keystrokes. The underlying tool that allows us to simulate user input in the browser is called Selenium. Capybara allows us to control Selenium using Ruby.

- Brilliant hello world example video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPcRiPrpQTc)



### Quick tips on testing

- Nice table translating what rspec calls various types of tests to what minitest calls them [here](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/test-pyramid-ruby-on-rails#ruby-on-rails-test-types)

From reinteractive's [article](https://reinteractive.com/posts/342-what-constitutes-good-testing-in-rails):

- What's the best framework? Ruby has minitest and Rspec; both are great, just be sure to use a framework - don't go writing your own DSL or doing testing in raw ruby code.

Testing in essence:

> you want to check if something returns the expected results for a known input


**On TDD**

> I am personally not a hardcore fan of any of those camps. Sometimes I write the test before I write the actual code. However, there are also times when I write the code first and then the test. The important part is that I have a test for my new feature. Whether you write the test before or after doesn't really matter, as long as it is there by the time you push your code to review and merge it to the main codebase.


To what extent should you test?

Author:

> I'll test the 'happy path' (both arguments provided), possible error paths (e.g. both arguments `nil`), and with one argument as `nil`.

It would look like this:

```ruby
def full_name
  "#{first_name} #{last_name}".strip
end

describe "#full_name" do
  let(:user) { User.new(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name) }

  context "with first name and last name" do
    let!(:first_name) { 'sylvester' }
    let!(:last_name) { 'stallone' }

    it "shows the full name" do
      expect(user.full_name).to eq('sylvester stallone')
    end
  end

  context "when both first and last names are nil" do
    let!(:first_name) { nil }
    let!(:last_name) { nil }

    it "shows the full name" do
      expect(user.full_name).to eq('')
    end
  end

  context "when only one name is present" do
    let!(:first_name) { 'sylvester' }
    let!(:last_name) { nil }

    it "shows the full name" do
      expect(user.full_name).to eq('sylvester')
    end
  end
end
```

> If it's not critical code, test the 'happy path', the worst case scenario, and one other test.


Don't test frameworks/libraries (trust their maintainers and the community to do that).

**Validation tests**

Use [shoulda gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda) (some more examples [here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda#overview)):


```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
 describe '#validations' do
   it { should validate_presence_of(:first_name) }
 end
```

**Example of testing that data got stored in database correctly** (from [rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#putting-it-together)):

```rb
test "should update article" do
  article = articles(:one)

  patch article_url(article), params: { article: { title: "updated" } }

  assert_redirected_to article_path(article)
  # Reload association to fetch updated data and assert that title is updated.
  article.reload
  assert_equal "updated", article.title
end
```


Always write readable tests:

> Tests usually serve as documentation for your code. Try to write them in a way that someone can understand the intention of the code simply by reading your tests.

> with an existing project, the first thing most of us will do is to run the test suite to see if it passes.


You can run `rspec spec --format documentation` to print the documentation when running tests. It's good practice to use the documentation command above to check whether your spec is readable.


**System tests use Capybara**

- System tests (those with an automated browswer simulating user clicks etc) [use capybara](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/testing.html#system-testing) under the hood.
- Capybara docs: https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#setup
- Capybara methods (like `click_on`, `fill_in` and `assert_text`): https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#the-dsl




### My quick notes on capybara

- Capybara comes with a new rails app, enables browser automation for systems tests
  - You can get it to do pretty much anything you'd expect with browser automation: easily find elements on the page and click on them, enter info into forms etc
- Capybara quick and dirty docs at their readme: https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#the-dsl
- And more complete reference: https://rubydoc.info/github/teamcapybara/capybara/master

Some random examples to explore (form [Capybara docs](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#clicking-links-and-buttons)):

```rb
click_link('id-of-link')
click_link('Link Text')
click_button('Save')
click_on('Link Text') # clicks on either links or buttons
click_on('Button Value')
```

Querying (AKA selecting elements on the page, a bit like javascript's `document.querySelector()`/`document.querySelectorAll()`):

```rb
page.has_selector?('table tr')
page.has_selector?(:xpath, './/table/tr')

page.has_xpath?('.//table/tr')
page.has_css?('table tr.foo')
page.has_content?('foo')
```



Interacting with forms:

```rb
fill_in('First Name', with: 'John')
fill_in('Password', with: 'Seekrit')
fill_in('Description', with: 'Really Long Text...')
choose('A Radio Button')
check('A Checkbox')
uncheck('A Checkbox')
attach_file('Image', '/path/to/image.jpg')
select('Option', from: 'Select Box')
```

And a LOT more (check the [readme](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara)).



### Quick notes on mocks and stubs

- A good use case / example of both is in a hypothetical set of tests for sending an sms in a rails application. In prod, you want it to send, in dev, you might want it to send to the developer's phone (stored in rails creds), and in test, you might want the method to simply log (rather than send any real sms)


#### Stubs

"Stubbing" refers to the practice of replacing a method or function with a simplified version that behaves in a predictable way, specifically for testing purposes.

When you "stub out" a method, you're essentially overriding its behavior for the duration of a test so that it doesn't execute its real logic. Instead, it might return a hard-coded value, raise a specific exception, or simply do nothing.

E.g. using a tool like RSpec, you can stub out the sns.publish method to avoid making the external call and check that it would have been called with the right arguments:

```ruby
it "attempts to send an SMS with the correct parameters" do
  sender = SmsSender.new("1234567890", "Hello, World!")
  expect_any_instance_of(Aws::SNS::Client).to receive(:publish).with(hash_including(
    phone_number: "1234567890",
    message: "Hello, World!"
  ))
  sender.send
end
```

When you set an expectation on a method with receive, RSpec will also stub that method. This means that when the publish method is called during the test, it won't execute its original logic but will instead just acknowledge the method call (to check against the expectation).


#### Mocks

Similar to stubs as outlined [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17810004/5783745):

> **Stubs** provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.

> **Mocks** objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.




### Nice example of GitHub Action for CI to run RSpec tests for rails 7 app (postgres db)

## RSpec

- To run RSpec tests, simply: `bundle exec rspec` (or simply `rspec`)
- What does `let` do? `let` simply creates a variable [but it lazy evaluates it](https://pololu.github.io/rpicsim/file.IntroductionToRSpec.html#label-Let+variables), in other words, it only evaluates it when the variable is actually used. I'm pretty sure it memoizes (which is approximately equal to 'caches') it too, so it's kinda 'made once, used many times' rather than being recreated over and over.
- It looks like when you [install and setup Rspec](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec) it creates a /spec directory. I *think* everything inside it will get run automatically as part of RSpec tests, so long as it ends in `_spec.rb` (a file I created that ended in `_helper.rb` did *not* get run).
- To remove records from the test database between test runs, see [here](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner#rspec-example)


A few notes about organising RSpec tests:

- After setting up RSpec, any new scaffolds will automatically set up RSpec tests (a la 'reviews' tests in HW app).
- The scaffold will also generate 'routes' tests - by default testing all 7 controller actions (and update via PUT and PATCH).
- As for controller tests? (there's no directory for those). From rorlink: "You should use requests specs instead of controllers. Request specs tests all from routes, to actions and rendering.". Also confirmed [here](https://medium.com/just-tech/rspec-controller-or-request-specs-d93ef563ef11)
- Similarlly helpers/ directory is to test the helpers in your app. (see Rspec docs [here](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/5-0/docs/helper-specs/helper-spec))


Setting up a test:

- I *think* each test file should have `require 'rails_helper'` otherwise the helpers (and even something like `binding.pry`) will not be accessible from rspec tests.


## Factories and Fixtures

From [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7786207/whats-the-difference-between-a-fixture-and-a-factory-in-my-unit-tests):

<blockquote>
  A Fixture is "the fixed state used as a baseline for running tests in software testing"
  A Factory is "an object for creating other objects"
</blockquote>


From [rails guide on testing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#what-are-fixtures-questionmark):


- Interesting comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/13lvzk4/comment/jksu5n8/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) saying they wouldn't use fixtures at all.

> What are fixtures? **Fixtures is a fancy word for sample data**. Fixtures allow you to populate your testing database with predefined data before your tests run. Fixtures are database independent and written in YAML. There is one file per model.


> YAML-formatted fixtures are a human-friendly way to describe your sample data.


Example:

```yaml
# lo & behold! I am a YAML comment!
david:
  name: David Heinemeier Hansson
  birthday: 1979-10-15
  profession: Systems development

steve:
  name: Steve Ross Kellock
  birthday: 1974-09-27
  profession: guy with keyboard
```


### Faker


Allows us to change this:

```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :customer do
    first_name { "MyString" }
    last_name { "MyString" }
    email { "MyString" }
  end
end
```

to this:

```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :customer do
    first_name { Faker::Name.first_name }
    last_name { Faker::Name.last_name }
    email { Faker::Internet.email }
  end
end
```

That solves the problem of any unique constraints we have in the db (e.g. 'email' field might have the requirement that it's unique). Example from [here](https://www.codewithjason.com/set-rails-application-testing/).










# Summary of notes from Agile Web Development with Rails 5


How to think of classes and objects in an object oriented language like ruby:

> When you write object-oriented code, you're normally looking to model concepts from the real world. Typically, during this modelling process you discover categories of thinks that need to be represented. In an online  store, the concept of a line item could be such a category. In Ruby, you'd define a *class* to represent each of these categories. You then use this class as a kind of factory that generates *objects* - instances of that class. An object is a combination of state (for example, the quantity and the product ID) and methods that use the state (perhaps a method to calculate the line the line item's total cost. (p47)

- You create objects by calling a *constructor*, a special method associated with a class. The standard constructor is called `new()`.
- You invoke methods by sending a message to an object. The message contains the method's name, along with any parameters the method may need.
- Rails uses *symbols* to identify things. In particular, it uses them as keys when naming method parameters and looking things up in hashes.
  - A symbol looks like a variable name, but it's prefixed with a colon. You can think of symbols as string literals magically made into constants. Alternatively, you can consider the colon to mean *thing named*, so `:id` is the thing named `id`.





# Upgrading a ruby or rails version


**General resources**:

- Railsdiff (explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljgmjoIv4Y8&t=5m46s), link [here](https://railsdiff.org/)) - use it when upgrading from one rails version to another.
- Awesome guide from rorlink [here](https://github.com/railslink/resources/wiki/Rails:-Upgrade-process).



**General notes**


- [This walkthrough](https://satchel.works/@wclittle/how-to-upgrade-ruby-versions-within-your-ruby-on-rails-app) suggests running `yarn upgrade` to upgrade javascript packages after you finish updating gems.
- You can delete `yarn.lock` and `node_modules/` and run `yarn install` to grab javascript packages.
- Run `node --version` to see the node version.






**Notes on upgrading from ruby 2.x.x to 3.x.x**:

- When upgrading from ruby 2 to 3, upgrade to the latest 2.x version first, then run tests and play around with the app for a while. The main difference between 2 and 3 is positional vs keyword arguments. The latest patch of 2.x (2.7) warns where there could be a change in behaviour. Hence why going to 2.7 first is a good idea. From [here](https://reinteractive.com/posts/499-no-app-left-behind-upgrade-your-application-to-ruby-3-0-and-stay-on-the-upgrade-path)

- [Ruby-lang notes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/) on positional vs keyword arguments when going to ruby 3.x.x.







**Workflow notes**:

From [here](https://makandracards.com/makandra/59328-how-to-upgrade-rails-workflow-advice):

- Do a separate step for each major Rails version (A). So, if you want to upgrade from Rails 3 to 5, I would do it in two steps 3.x -> 4.2 -> 5.2. [Here](https://makandracards.com/makandra/59328-how-to-upgrade-rails-workflow-advice#section-workflow-for-each-major-rails-upgrade-a) is a workflow for going from one major rails version to another.
- From [rails guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#the-upgrade-process): When changing Rails versions, it's best to move slowly, one minor version at a time, in order to make good use of the deprecation warnings. Rails version numbers are in the form Major.Minor.Patch.
  - Upgrade your gems together with Rails if possible.
- Upgrade Ruby in a separate step.
- If your code base is very large you might need to go in smaller increments.

- Discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/11nxqqv/comment/jbpmp9i/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

> Trying to run an old rails on a ruby version that didn't exist when the rails version was written is a recipe for many confusing issues.

also

> Gems first, then rails, then ruby.


- So tl;dr, upgrading rails before ruby is a good idea, but probably only if the rails version was made to work on that particular version of ruby.


An **example workflow** from rails 6.0.4.4 / ruby 2.7.1 could look like:

0. Make sure you have good test coverage!
1. Upgrade to rails 6.1.4.4
2. Upgrade to rails 7 (note that "Rails 7 requires Ruby 2.7.0 or newer" ([here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html))). Note [steps](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71112586/5783745) for dealing with webpacker when upgrading to rails 7 (more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jQn7EP3N53c55p601bgnxw5HO8jMLXhu0EDZCW6SWmQ/edit#).
3. Upgrade to ruby 3.x.x
4. Migrate to hotwire from UJS/Turbolinks. DK: Keep your browser's console up as you're working through this. You'll uncover a bunch of "hidden" issues.
5. keep webpack for the time being. migrate to esbuild (or whatever) as a second step.
6. move to cssbundling








# Generators

- Great way to see available options [here](https://wasabigeek.github.io/railshelp).
- Great way to see avaialble `rails new` options interactively [here](https://railsnew.app/) (by axel from ror link).



# Miscellaneous notes

- On the role of models vs controllers (from John M):

>  The idea of fat models/skinny controllers is that models should encapsulate business logic. Well business logic and behavior, whereas controllers act more like orchestrators/handling the request/response layer.

- If some code that would ordinarily go in the model but doesn't belong there, for example if it's used across many controllers and would seem odd going in one model, then place it in a module. More on that [here](https://medium.com/@qasimali7566675/ruby-on-rails-best-practices-every-developer-should-know-6a4ed5b7e43f).

- To include modules in classes, for example include a helper (view helper) from one controller in another, or in the rails console, use something like this:

```rb
include ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper
# or just
include ActionView::Helpers
```

- More info on [how to create and use a module]() and [where to put a module in a rails app](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4013685/5783745)





# Rails 7 Turbo Drive, Turbo Frames, and Turbo Streams

- From hotwire docs [here](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/):

> Turbo Drive accelerates links and form submissions by negating the need for full page reloads.

> Turbo Frames decompose pages into independent contexts, which scope navigation and can be lazily loaded.

> Turbo Streams deliver page changes over WebSocket, SSE or in response to form submissions using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like actions.

### Notes and resources on hotwire, stimulus and the Turbos

- Nice simple tutorial on hotwire [here](https://monn.app/blog/the-simplest-ruby-on-rails-and-hotwire-app-possible-beginners-guide), found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/13tratd/learn_hotwire_by_building_the_simplest_possible/). Update: on waybackmachine [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240421192038/https://railsnotes.xyz/blog/the-simplest-ruby-on-rails-and-hotwire-app-possible-beginners-guide)





### Creating a dom_id so the turbo_stream knows what to target

```ruby
include ActionView::Helpers
dom_id(Todo.new)
# => "new_todo"
dom_id(Todo.last)
# => "todo_65"
```

In other words, if `dom_id()` receives a `.new` object, it will recognise that and simply give the element a dom_id of "new_thing".



# Deployment


- Interesting advice [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/14khvxe/hosting_rails_app_on_aws/)) on deploying to EC2s - Tl;dr: don't. It's too much work and even with thorough GoRails guides, it's still more complicated. Go with a PaaS, pay a little to save a tonne of time/effort.
  - If you must go on aws, use elastic bean stalk (see comment in above thread)








# More random things to follow up at some point


Looking at `javascript_include_tag` which is used in application.html.erb when using esbuild, it's [source code](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/de29ff225e47ddee3e5a1f2289a44852e5a65eb9/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/asset_tag_helper.rb#L111) contains [`extract_options!`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Array.html#method-i-extract_options-21):


A note on loading the active_support library

When using irb (not in a rails app), I thought `require 'active_support'` would make extract_options! available, but it doesn't. it's also necessary to do this: `require 'active_support/core_ext'`. Why? Because loading the active_support library doesn't automatically load all its extensions and modules (since doing so could slow down your application), instead you have to specifically load them yourself e.g. require 'active_support/core_ext'

To see which modules and extensions a library contains, consult its official documentation you can load everything with require 'active_support/all'

Note that presumably everything in this [active_support directory](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activesupport/lib/active_support) is also an extension/module within active_support. It contains 'core_ext' as well as 'all' and a heap of others.


```rb
# Example from rails api:

def options(*args)
  args.extract_options!
end

options(1, 2)        # => {}
options(1, 2, a: :b) # => {:a=>:b}


# My playing around

def thing(*sources)
  options = sources.extract_options!.stringify_keys
  puts options
  puts options.class
  puts options.length
  options.each do |k, v|
    puts "key: " + k + " value: " + v
  end
end

thing(a: "abc", b: "def")

# {"a"=>"abc", "b"=>"def"}
# Hash
# 2
# key: a value: abc
# key: b value: def
# => {"a"=>"abc", "b"=>"def"}


```



# More random notes


### To install and use brakeman

It's very easy, add to Gemfile, then run `brakeman`

To see it work, try adding this to the users controller, it should detect the SQL injection attack vector

```ruby

@users = User.where("name = '#{params[:name]}'")

```
